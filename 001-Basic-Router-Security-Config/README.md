# CCNA Lab 001: Basic router Security Configuration

# Objective
Configure basic router security between two routers (R1 and R2) using Cisco Packet Tracer.

# Topology
- 2 Routers: R1 and R2  
- Connection: GigabitEthernet0/0  

# Tasks
1. Connect R1 and R2 by their GigabitEthernet0/0 interfaces.  
2. Set hostnames (R1 and R2).  
3. Set the enable password on each router to `cisco`.  
4. View the password in the running configuration.  
5. Enable password encryption.  
6. View the password again.  
7. Disable password encryption.  
8. Verify configuration.
